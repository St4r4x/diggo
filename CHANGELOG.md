## [Unreleased]

## 2026-05-29

### Added
- `scripts/pre_filter.py` — `_score_legitimacy()` function: penalises low-quality offers with -0.5 for thin description (<300 chars), -0.3 for no tech skills, -0.2 for no salary info; penalty capped at -0.5; adds `legitimacy:thin_desc`, `legitimacy:no_tech`, `legitimacy:no_salary`, and `legitimacy:suspicious` tags
- `scripts/pre_filter.py` — wired `_score_legitimacy()` call into `score_offer()` before the final return
- `tests/test_pre_filter.py` — `TestLegitimacy` class with 4 tests covering thin desc, no tech, no salary (no suspicious tag), and clean offer; `_CLEAN_DESC` constant for legitimacy-neutral descriptions

### Changed
- `tests/test_pre_filter.py` — updated `TestNewSignals` tests to use `_CLEAN_DESC` or relative assertions instead of exact scores, since legitimacy penalties now apply to short/sparse descriptions
- `tests/test_pre_filter.py` — updated `TestSalaryNormalized` tests to use `_SALARY_BASE` padded descriptions and comparative assertions to decouple from legitimacy side-effects



### Changed
- `scripts/pre_filter.py` — replaced flat salary signal (+0.3 if raw value in range) with package-aware `_score_salary()`: reconstructs French annual package from base salary, 13th month, RTT days, titre-restaurant, and intéressement; returns +0.5 if total in target range, -0.3 if out of range, 0.0 if no salary found
- `scripts/pre_filter.py` — added 4 new regex constants: `_MONTHS_13_RE`, `_RTT_RE`, `_TR_RE`, `_INTERESSEMENT_RE`
- `tests/test_pre_filter.py` — updated `test_salary_in_range` and `test_salary_out_of_range` in `TestNewSignals` to match new +0.5/-0.3 values; added `TestSalaryNormalized` class with 5 tests for package-aware salary logic

## 2026-05-28

### Added
- `scripts/rescore.py` — migration script to rescore all existing DB offers with updated signals; supports `--dry-run` and `--db PATH` flags
- `scripts/pre_filter.py` — 5 new scoring signals: tech skills in description (+0.1/skill, cap +1.0), experience ≤ threshold (+0.5), CDI mention (+0.3), salary in target range (+0.3), ATS quality portal bonus (+0.3); `_normalize_company()` strips noisy suffixes before company matching
- `tests/test_rescore.py` — 8 tests: `TestInferPortal` (4) and `TestRescore` (dry-run, update, idempotency, summary)
- `tests/test_pre_filter.py` — `TestNewSignals` class with 11 tests for all new signals
- `dashboard/templates/partials/scan_status.html` — HTMX partial for scan button/badge (idle, running, done, error states)
- `dashboard/app.py` — `POST /scan/start` and `GET /scan/status` endpoints: trigger full import pipeline as asyncio Task with live HTMX polling feedback
- `tests/test_dashboard_app.py` — `TestScan` (6 tests) and `TestPrepareCandidature` (1 test)

### Changed
- `scripts/backfill_descriptions.py` — replaced Playwright with HTTP for APEC and Ashby
  - `ApecApiExtractor`: calls internal REST webservice (`cms/webservices/offre/public`) discovered via network interception; no browser
  - `AshbyJsonLdExtractor`: fetches static HTML and parses the embedded JSON-LD `JobPosting` block; no browser
  - Playwright now only launched when Indeed URLs are present (~2% of offers)
- `scripts/backfill_descriptions.py` — replaced Playwright with public REST APIs for Lever and Greenhouse
  - `LeverApiExtractor`: uses `api.lever.co/v0/postings/{company}/{uuid}`, prefers `descriptionPlain`
  - `GreenhouseApiExtractor`: uses `boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/{company}/jobs/{id}`, HTML → text via `_html_to_text` (with `html.unescape` pre-pass for doubly-encoded entities)
  - Browser lazy-initialized only when at least one URL requires it
- `dashboard/templates/base.html` — renamed nav link "Pipeline" → "Candidatures"
- `dashboard/app.py` — `GET /` passes `status` and `result` to template for initial scan button render; lifespan initializes `scan_status`/`scan_result` on `app.state`
- `dashboard/templates/index.html` — scan button added to filter bar via `scan_status.html` include
- `scripts/import_offers.py` — `score_to_grade()` thresholds recalibrated: A≥4.0, B≥3.0, C≥2.0, D≥1.0, F<1.0
- `tests/test_dashboard_app.py` — `client` fixture initializes `scan_status`/`scan_result` to avoid lifespan bypass issues

### Removed
- 15 unrecoverable offers deleted from DB:
  - 8 × Indeed `pagead/clk` tracking URLs (one-shot redirects, irrecoverable)
  - 7 × APEC expired offers (returned empty from scraper)

## 2026-05-27

### Added
- `dashboard/profile_parser.py` — `load_profile()` / `save_profile()` to read/write `config/profile.md` + `config/contact.yaml`
- `dashboard/templates/profile.html` — full profile page with accordion sections
- `dashboard/templates/partials/profile_contact.html` — contact section (7 fields, HTMX POST)
- `dashboard/templates/partials/profile_summary.html` — summary textarea, HTMX POST
- `dashboard/templates/partials/profile_experience.html` — experience cards with add/remove, HTMX POST
- `dashboard/templates/partials/profile_skills.html` — skill tags by category with add/remove, HTMX POST
- `dashboard/templates/partials/profile_education.html` — education cards + certifications textarea, HTMX POST
- `dashboard/templates/partials/profile_projects.html` — project cards with add/remove, HTMX POST
- `tests/test_profile_parser.py` — 8 parser unit tests including roundtrip
- `tests/test_profile_routes.py` — route tests covering all 6 POST endpoints (invalid JSON, persistence, error handling)
- `scripts/backfill_descriptions.py` — initial Playwright-based backfill script (APEC + Lever); later replaced with HTTP-first architecture

### Changed
- `dashboard/app.py` — added GET `/profile` + 6 POST routes (`/profile/contact`, `/profile/summary`, `/profile/experience`, `/profile/skills`, `/profile/education`, `/profile/projects`)
- `dashboard/templates/base.html` — added "Profil" nav link with active state

### Fixed
- `dashboard/app.py` — moved `import json` and `import profile_parser` to module level (were inside function bodies)
- `dashboard/app.py` — education route catches `AttributeError` in addition to `json.JSONDecodeError`
- `dashboard/profile_parser.py` — strengthened `_split_sections` guard; module-level `_PROFILE_MD` / `_CONTACT_YAML` constants for test monkeypatching
